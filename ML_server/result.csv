9,0,"I had to give this an &#34;OK&#34; just because I'm sure someone would like this tablet (I returned it).  However, having had the 3 g Kindle first I didn't care for this tablet for two reasons.  Number one: I only had Wifi and no 3g which means I can only buy and download a movie or book when I am at home or where there is free Wifi.  With my Kindle, I was in Europe and could download wherever I wanted.  I did not want to spend the extra money for the 4g and then have to have a designated line (pay for it).<br />Number two: It kept knocking me off my e-mail on my laptop which was aggravating having to keep signing in on my laptop e-mail.<br />Also, too confusing since I have been using Apple products which are so user friendly.",1,0
